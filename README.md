# CounterFactual-XAI-Tutorials-and-Papers


CFX (CounterFactual eXplanation) is a popular method for model explanation. It is a post-hoc way that can give actionable explanations to a model result. In this repo, I will list out some SOTA related to CFX.

### Model-Agnostic Methods
- DiCE
- CFRL by Seldon Alibi
### Gradient-Bassed Methods
- CEM
- DiCE
- GeCo
### Model-Specific Methods
- Actionable Recourse in Linear Classification
- Efficient Search for Diverse Coherent Explanations
### CFX on Other Models
- KS Test
  -  Comprehensible Counterfactual Explanation on Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test  [[paper](http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p1583-cong.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/research0610/MOCHE)]
